## Linter Setup & Usage

This project uses [Flutter Lints](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_lints) for enforcing coding standards and best practices.

Linter configuration is found in `analysis_options.yaml`.

### How to Run Linter

To analyze your code and check for lint issues, run:

```powershell
flutter analyze
```

This will display any errors, warnings, or lint violations in your codebase.

### Custom Rules

You can customize lint rules in `analysis_options.yaml` under the `linter` section.
