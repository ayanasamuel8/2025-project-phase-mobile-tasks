## üèóÔ∏è App Architecture Overview

The app follows a layered, clean architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer:** UI and user interaction (not covered here)
2. **Domain Layer:** Business logic, entities, usecases
3. **Data Layer:** Data operations, mapping, repository implementations

**Data flow:**
- UI requests data via usecases (domain layer)
- Usecases interact with repositories, which delegate to the data layer
- Data layer fetches/parses data, maps to domain entities, and returns up the chain

---

## üèõÔ∏è Domain Layer

Located in `lib/features/products/domain`, following clean architecture principles.

**Structure:**
- `entities/`: Domain models (e.g., `product.dart`)
- `repositories/`: Repository interfaces (e.g., `product_repository.dart`)
- `usecases/`: Use case classes:
   - `create_product.dart`
   - `delete_product.dart`
   - `update_product.dart`
   - `view_all_products.dart`
   - `view_product.dart`

**Purpose:**
- Keeps business logic independent from UI/data layers
- Improves maintainability, testability, scalability

Refer to files in `lib/features/products/domain/` for details.

---

## üß™ Usecase Tests

Unit tests ensure correct business logic and repository interaction. Uses `mocktail` for mocking.

**Test files:**
- `create_product_test.dart`
- `delete_product_test.dart`
- `update_product_test.dart`
- `view_all_products_test.dart`
- `view_product_test.dart`

**Test coverage:**
- Correct repository method calls
- Success and failure scenarios
- Correct result types (`Right` for success, `Left` for failure)

**Run all tests:**
```powershell
flutter test
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Data Layer

Handles data operations, bridging external sources and domain layer.

### Structure
- **Models:**  
   `lib/features/products/data/models/`  
   Example: `ProductModel` extends domain `Product` and adds serialization.

- **Extendable:**  
   Add `datasources/` for API/local logic and `repositories/` for implementations.

### Data Flow
1. Fetch data from external source, parse with `ProductModel.fromJson()`
2. Use `ProductModel` in business logic (inherits domain entity)
3. Save/update with `ProductModel.toJson()`

**Example:**
```dart
final productMap = json.decode(productJson);
final productModel = ProductModel.fromJson(productMap);
final jsonMap = productModel.toJson();
```

### Data Layer Tests & Fixtures
- Tests: `product_model_test.dart`
- Uses fixture files (e.g., `product.json`) for sample data

**Test coverage:**
- Parsing from JSON (`fromJson`)
- Conversion to JSON (`toJson`)
- Round-trip conversion

**Sample test:**
```dart
test('fromJson returns correct ProductModel', () {
   final model = ProductModel.fromJson(productMap);
   expect(model.id, 1);
   expect(model.name, 'Product Name');
});
```

**Run data layer tests:**
```powershell
flutter test test/features/products/data/models/product_model_test.dart
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Data Layer Components & Integration

Recent additions for robust data management:

### Core Utilities
- `core/error/exceptions.dart`: Custom exceptions (`ServerException`, `CacheException`)
- `core/platform/network_info.dart`: Network connectivity abstraction

### Data Sources
- `product_local_data_source.dart`: Local data operations
- `product_remote_data_source.dart`: Remote data operations

### Repository Implementation
- `product_repository_impl.dart`: Implements domain repository, orchestrates data flow, handles network logic

### Data Layer Test
- `product_repository_impl_test.dart`: Unit tests for repository implementation, mocks data sources/network info

## ‚öôÔ∏è Dependency Injection: injection_container.dart

The app uses a dedicated dependency injection setup to manage and provide instances of repositories, data sources, and BLoCs throughout the app. This is implemented in `injection_container.dart` using the [get_it](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it) package.

**Location:**
- `lib/injection_container.dart`

**Purpose:**
- Centralizes registration of all dependencies
- Enables easy swapping of implementations for testing and scaling
- Supports constructor injection for BLoCs, repositories, and data sources

**How to use:**
- Call `init()` in your app's main entry point before running the app
- Retrieve dependencies anywhere using `sl<T>()`

**Testing:**
- Easily override dependencies in tests for mocking and isolation

Refer to `lib/injection_container.dart` for the full setup and customization options.

## üß™ Widget Testing for Pages

Widget tests are implemented for each major page to ensure UI components render correctly, respond to user interactions, and integrate with BLoC states as expected.

### Widget Test Coverage
- Located in: `test/features/products/presentation/pages/`
- Example test files:
  - `products_list_page_test.dart`: Verifies product list rendering, loading indicator, error messages, and navigation
  - `product_detail_page_test.dart`: Checks product details display, loading/error states, and back navigation
  - `product_form_page_test.dart`: Tests form validation, submission, and state changes

### Testing Approach
- Uses `flutter_test` and `mocktail` for widget and BLoC mocking
- Simulates user actions (tap, input, navigation)
- Verifies correct widget tree and state transitions
- Mocks BLoC states to test UI responses for loading, success, and error scenarios

**Run all widget tests:**
```powershell
flutter test test/features/products/presentation/pages/
```

Refer to each test file for detailed scenarios and sample widget test cases.
